#About Handy
Handy will be a trusted community marketplace for people to list, discover, and book unique services around the world - online or from a mobile device. Whether it’s a gardener on a weekend, a plumber for a pipe burst, or a ride to another city, Handy will aim to connect people to unique services at any price point.

For this project, we will build an application that acts as a middleman by connecting people who are looking to provide services such as moving, gardening, plumbing, repairing etc. (service providers) with people who are in need of these services(customers). 
 We plan to use the cloud to store user (both service providers and customer) data and facilitate communication between them.
